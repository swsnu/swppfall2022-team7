Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.';

      description: 'Break down each user story described in your requirements document into programming tasks. Determine the difficulty of each task, and try to estimate the number of developer-days that the tasks should take. Try to also determine dependencies among tasks. Then, you should list all of the tasks to be done in the current sprint, a preliminary assignment of tasks to people in the group, estimates of the time for each task, dependencies between tasks, and a preliminary division into sprints (e.g., which features are implemented in the first sprint, second sprint, and so on). The plan should be designed to get some prototype system running as quickly as possible and then growing towards to the full project over a sequence of sprints. Please pay extra attention to the dependency relationships between tasks; you will almost certainly run into the situation where one bit isn\'t done but everything else is waiting for it. In that case, you want to know exactly where resources need to go, and how urgent each bit is (hint: NOT proportional to its size or importance in the whole system).',
